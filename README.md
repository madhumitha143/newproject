# FAKE NEWS DETECTION USING NLP
# phase1
dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

## Introduction

This project aims to predict chatbot  using python. The project is divided into several phases, each addressing a different aspect of the AI development process.

We used a real-world dataset provided for our project by IBM named "MY CHATBOT" for our analysis of response .

### Open the Jupyter Notebook for the code phase:
If you have Anaconda installed, open the Anaconda Command Prompt and run the following command:

bash
jupyter notebook

This command opens Jupyter Notebook in your web browser and automatically displays the files in the current directory. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code. You can run the code cells by pressing "Ctrl + Enter" or by clicking the "Run" button in the Jupyter Notebook interface.
#### Note: The final code you need to run is named AI_5.ipynb.
## Final Documentation
For complete project documentation, refer to the Project Documentation (AI_PHASE5.doc) file. This document contains detailed information about our project, including the code, output, and screenshots of the code's results
